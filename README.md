# OSI Layer Project

## Overview
This project provides a hands-on exploration of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**, focusing on layers from **Data Link** to **Application**. It is designed for educational purposes to help understand how each layer functions through practical examples and modules.

The OSI model layers covered in this project:

1. **Data Link Layer** – Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
2. **Network Layer** – Manages data routing, addressing, and packet forwarding.
3. **Transport Layer** – Ensures reliable data transfer and flow control.
4. **Session Layer** – Manages sessions, connections, and communication between applications.
5. **Presentation Layer** – Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.
6. **Application Layer** – Provides network services directly to end-user applications.

## Features
- Layer-wise demonstration of network concepts.
- Scripts and tools for understanding protocols and packet flow.
- Educational examples suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.
- Modular design to explore layers independently.
